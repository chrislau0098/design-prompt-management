# 02 · Roles and Sub-agent Dispatch

> Who does what. When the main Cowork agent should do the work directly, when to dispatch a sub-agent, and how to write the sub-agent prompt so the result comes back with real verify proof — not a self-graded "PASS".

## The two roles

### Cowork (main session)

- **Model**: Opus (Anthropic, latest 4.x).
- **Job**: Planner and Architect. Receives feedback, decides what changes (Slot? template? renderer? produced md?), assembles the patch chain, dispatches sub-agents, **verifies their output independently** before reporting back.
- **Owns**: AGENTS.md, Round-Log.md, the three-way sync audit, the decision on whether to re-inject, the decision on whether a sub-agent's report is trustworthy.
- **Does not own**: doing every CSS tweak by hand (delegate), writing every Slot field (delegate), running every inject (delegate when the work is mechanical).

### Sub-agents (dispatched per task)

- **Model**: Opus for prose / Design Prompt text / template design / complex judgement. Sonnet for engineering / sync / verify / mechanical refactor.
- **Job**: Execute one bounded task with a self-contained prompt. Report back with verify proof in the structure Cowork requested.
- **Owns**: the work in their patch site, the verify evidence in their report.
- **Does not own**: the decision about *what* to change (Cowork decides), the three-way sync audit (Cowork verifies after).

## Model selection — Opus vs Sonnet

The rule comes from the example project's Round-86: pick the smaller model when the task is mechanical, the bigger model when the task asks for prose taste or hard judgement. Bullet form:

**Use Opus for:**
- Writing or editing a Design Prompt md (the weak model reads this — prose quality matters).
- Designing or rewriting `templates/prompt-template.md`.
- Extracting a style Slot from reference images (vision + semantic mapping is a taste call).
- Auditing three-way sync — calling out drift requires understanding the design intent, not just diffing strings.
- Resolving a Chris-style ambiguous feedback ("feels off", "looks slop") — needs an aesthetic judgement.

**Use Sonnet for:**
- HTML/CSS mechanical changes that have a clear before/after spec.
- Running `python3 inject.py` and reporting line counts / unrendered tokens.
- Syncing one source of truth to another (Slot → renderer inline data, template version bumps).
- Adding a component to the renderer when the spec is already a written CSS block.
- Refactors with explicit grep targets ("change every `bg-surface-l2 + border` to `bg-surface-l2` and report the line numbers").

Sonnet is faster and cheaper. Default to it for engineering. Only escalate to Opus when the work is taste-bound.

## When the main agent does the work directly

Skip the sub-agent when:

- The change is **one or two files** and **under ~30 minutes** for a human.
- The change touches **multiple coupled systems** (Slot + template + renderer + produced md) and the cross-system reasoning would be lost in handoff.
- The change is a **judgement call you cannot delegate** (e.g. "is this signature ornament the right one?").
- A **prior sub-agent** has already failed twice on the same task — the third try is on you.

The example project's Round-92 (festive-royal Cinnabar + festive-editorial Crimson Bar) was a Cowork-direct case: two ornaments, tightly coupled to Slot tokens + renderer + template, where R-90/R-91 had shown sub-agents struggle to mirror existing per-pack CSS overrides across packs.

## How to write a sub-agent prompt

The prompt must be self-contained — the sub-agent has no memory of your conversation. Include all of:

### A · Identity and bound
```
You are sub-agent X (model: Sonnet, engineering task) under Cowork (R-NN, project ...).
Your task: <one sentence>.
Out of scope: <what you must NOT touch>.
```

### B · Inputs — paths and lines, not summaries
```
Read first:
- /abs/path/to/Round-Log.md §1 + most recent round
- /abs/path/to/templates/prompt-template.md lines L-L
- /abs/path/to/src/data/<style>.slot.json
```

Use **absolute paths**. Sub-agents in worktrees have their CWD reset between bash calls; relative paths break silently.

### C · What to change, concretely
```
Patch sites:
1. <abs path> — <what + why, 1-2 sentences>
2. ...
```

Avoid "improve" / "polish" / "make it better". State the diff. If you cannot state the diff, you do not have a sub-agent task — you have a Cowork task.

### D · Verify proof requirements (do not skip)

This is the part that fails most often. The example project's R-94 #35 and R-87 #18 are both about Cowork accepting a sub-agent's self-grade and finding real drift later. Always require **rendered evidence**:

```
Verify proof you must return:
1. ls -la <each produced file or directory> — full output
2. wc -l <each produced md> + grep -c '<invariant>' <file> for each invariant
3. cat -n <key file> lines L-L showing the actual changed lines
4. (for renderer work) curl http://localhost:5173 returns 200 + DOM evidence
   via mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_eval `document.querySelectorAll(...)` count
5. Anti-slop grep: grep -nE '<pattern>' <files> with EXPECTED count
```

### E · Report format
```
Report in this structure (under 800 words):
- Files changed: <list>
- Lines added / removed: <wc -l before vs after>
- Verify proof: <pasted output of each item in §D>
- Pitfalls hit: <anything tricky you decided>
- Open questions for Cowork: <if any>
```

### F · Discipline reminder
```
- Do not invent file paths. If a path does not exist, ls its parent and report what is there.
- Do not self-grade "PASS" without the §D evidence. A bare "all good" report = rejected.
- If you get stuck, report cleanly. Do not hallucinate work you did not do.
```

## After a sub-agent returns

Cowork **always** does an independent verify pass — never trusts the sub-agent's report alone. Minimum:

1. `ls -la <produced path>` yourself.
2. `wc -l <produced files>` yourself.
3. Grep for the same invariants you asked the sub-agent to grep — confirm the counts match.
4. For renderer work: open the renderer (or use Claude Preview) and look at the result. The example project's R-95 sub-agent reports trended trustworthy *after* Cowork ran the same DOM eval and confirmed the numbers matched.
5. If there is a mismatch, **report the mismatch in Round-Log §2**; do not silently re-dispatch.

## Common failure modes and counter-prompts

| Failure | Counter |
|---|---|
| Sub-agent patches one render path, leaves N others unpatched (R-87 ShadCard children bug, R-90 chapter opener × 7). | "Enumerate every render path. Grep `function render.*<thing>` and list line numbers. Patch each one." |
| Sub-agent copies a CSS pattern from one pack to another but drops a critical rule (R-91 missed `flex-direction: column` mirror). | "When mirroring pack X's CSS to pack Y, list every CSS rule in X's per-pack block and confirm each is mirrored." |
| Sub-agent self-grades "all 6 styles PASS" without DOM verify (R-94 #35, R-90 #24). | Require `mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_eval document.querySelectorAll(...).length` numbers in the report. |
| Sub-agent uses smart-quotes by accident in JS strings (R-90 fontFamily bug). | `grep -nP '[‘’“”]' <files>` must return 0. |
| Sub-agent writes to its worktree CWD instead of canonical path (Cowork R-94 #35 misjudgement). | Always pass absolute canonical paths. Sub-agent reports `ls -la <abs canonical path>` to prove the destination. |

## When to escalate vs continue

- One sub-agent failure → re-dispatch with a tighter prompt (add a §D verify-proof item that covers the missed case).
- Two failures on the same task → Cowork does it directly.
- A failure that exposes a missing principle → add the principle to the project's Round-Log §1, then dispatch.
